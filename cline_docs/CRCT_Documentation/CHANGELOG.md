## [8.0.0] - 2025-12-02

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MAJOR RELEASE** - Significant architectural changes to embedding and dependency analysis systems. See [MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md](MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md) for upgrade instructions.

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- **Embedding System Rewrite**: Migrated from simple content-based to Symbol Essence String (SES) architecture
  - Embeddings now include runtime type info, inheritance, decorators, and comprehensive symbol metadata
  - **Action Required**: Regenerate all embeddings with `analyze-project --force-embeddings`

- **New Dependencies**: Added `llama-cpp-python` and `huggingface_hub`
  - Required for GGUF model support and automatic model downloads
  - **Action Required**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- **Runtime Symbol Inspection**: Requires valid, importable Python modules
  - Syntax errors in project files may prevent symbol extraction
  - **Action Required**: Fix syntax errors before running `analyze-project`

- **CLI Deprecation**: `set_char` command is now **unsafe** and deprecated
  - Operates on outdated grid structure and can corrupt tracker files
  - **Action Required**: Use `add-dependency` with `--source-key` and `--target-key` instead

### 🎯 Major Features

#### Symbol Essence Strings (SES) - Revolutionary Embedding Architecture

### 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Embedding Generation**: 2-3x faster with optimal batch sizing
- **Dependency Suggestions**: 5-10x more accurate with reranker
- **Analysis Time**: Similar or slightly slower on first run (runtime inspection overhead), faster on subsequent runs (better caching)
- **Memory Usage**: Higher peak during reranker operations, better managed with unloading
- **Cache Efficiency**: 30-50% memory savings with compression for large projects

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- Reranker may timeout on very large dependency graphs (4000+ edges) - use visualization sparingly
- Runtime inspection requires importable modules (fix syntax errors first)
- GGUF model download requires stable internet connection (600MB)
- First-run analysis slower due to model downloads and SES generation complexity

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed parser state conflicts with local parser instances (vs global)
- Improved call filtering to reduce noise in suggestions
- Better handling of relative imports in Python
- Enhanced error recovery in runtime inspection
- Resolved cache key collisions with improved hashing

### 🗑️ Removed

- **DEPRECATED**: `exceptions.py` → Replaced by `exceptions_enhanced.py`
  - Migration: Update imports from `core.exceptions` to `core.exceptions_enhanced`
  - Old exception classes are still available for backward compatibility

### 📝 Documentation

- **NEW**: [MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md](MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md) - Comprehensive migration guide
- Updated README with v8.0 features and system requirements
- Enhanced inline documentation throughout codebase

### 🔄 Migration Notes

1. **Install New Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install  # for mermaid-cli if using visualization
   ```

2. **Regenerate Embeddings**:

   python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor analyze-project --force-embeddings
   ```

3. **Run Runtime Inspector** (if using Python projects):
   ```bash
   python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.analysis.runtime_inspector
   ```

4. **Expected First-Run Behavior**:
   - Automatic download of Qwen3 reranker model (~600MB)
   - Longer initial embedding generation (due to SES complexity)
   - Runtime inspection may fail on files with syntax errors

5. **System Requirements Update**:
   - **Recommended**: 8GB+ VRAM or 16GB+ RAM for optimal performance
   - **Minimum**: 4GB RAM for CPU-only mode with reduced batch sizes
